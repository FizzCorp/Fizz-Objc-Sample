# Fizz-objC-Sample

For your convenience the sample is preconfigured with the embedded frameworks. All you need to do is, open **FizzSample.xcodeproj** in Xcode and hit the run button. You may need to change the bundle identifier and provisioning profiles to make it device ready. 
But the sample is ready to test with simulator without following any extra steps. The sample is a single view application with major portion of code written in ```FizzSample > Views > MainVC.m ``` which also serves as the entry point for the application.
